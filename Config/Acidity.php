///////Acidity - Acid Reference Conversions relevant to fermentation///////
/*
 * When we titrate a must or wine for acidity, all we really determine is the number of available hydrogen (H+) ions in the wine and not the types of acid present.
 * For this reason we must choose an acid as a reference in order to express the acidity as a concentration.
 * Different winemaking texts use different acid references when referring to titratable acidity levels.
 * Most use tartaric acid (the main acid in grapes) as the reference, with units of either percent or grams/litre (parts per thousand, or ppt).
 * However, other texts use different acids as the reference, with sulfuric acid being a popular alternative to tartaric acid.
 * For cider-making, malic acid (the main acid in apples) is often used.
 *
 * milli-equivalent is used as the base in the these calculations as it does not depend on the acid type.
 * The conversion is the molecular weight divided by (number of h+ ions + 1000)
 *
 * Thanks to FermCalc for these calculations: http://fermcalc.com/conversions/
